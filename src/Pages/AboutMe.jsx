                <h1>A little something about me...</h1>
                <p>I began my journey at Monash University Malaysia with a focus on gaining fundamental skills through their Data Science courses. But as I delved deeper, I found myself increasingly captivated by the world of Web Development. There's something incredibly exciting about creating visually stunning websites and exploring all the cool features they can offer.</p>
                <p>Driven by this newfound passion, I decided to shift gears and dive into web development.</p>
                <p>I started taking Udemy courses and immersed myself in online tutorials. Through this process, Iâ€™ve been working on various small projects, experimenting with different design ideas, and honing my skills. My goal is to keep evolving as a web developer and continue creating engaging, beautiful websites."</p>
